All about making a website!

## This Site

Feel free to get your own copy of this site
([github](https://github.com/victorgan/victorgan.github.io))
([zip](https://github.com/victorgan/victorgan.github.io/archive/master.zip)) to
play around with. Here's how this site is made.

### Host: GitHub Pages
Pros: Free and lets you push static files. It's convenient if you already have
your site in a git repository.
Cons: Static pages only.

### Site Generator / Content Management System: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
Mostly because it's already integrated with GitHub pages. You write files in
plain text/markdown and Jekyll converts the files to static HTML pages with a
template applied.  

### Registrar: Namecheap
I've been using them for a while without complaints.

[Here](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/)
are some pictures to help you get set up. Step 1 is creating a file with your
URL, and step 2 is pointing the forwarding address to GitHub's servers.

### Website Template Base: Poole 
[Here](http://getpoole.com/). 

### Website Additions: Disqus Comments, Navigation Links, Google Analytics
Pretty much everything in
[this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) guide.

### Website Additions: MathJax
This allows math equations to look pretty like \\( 1/x^{2} \\), 
or in block, \\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\] 

### Purpose

For now, I'm using this site as a notebook that doesn't get lost. I have a
journal in a text file, which is good as a catch-all for one-off ideas. I
have a section in OneNote, which is alright for some ideas and also lets me put
in pictures, but one, the formatting is visually terrible, and two, it's in a
proprietary file format. 

Two is a minor problem since I'm worried five years

One is a problem because there's a disconnect in evolving ideas from ad-hoc
scraps to something more polished: it's not worth trying to edit the page to
make it look better, and lots of effort is needed to making a fresh, clean page.
I've come to relish the power of making small, easy iterations possible.

I've come to the conclusion web pages are the best file format for documents.
Latex and PDFs take too much effort. Word or Google documents are alright, but
not as easily viewed. And they have too many formatting options. Plus, if it's
on this website I know there's a 'canonical' version of sorts: there's no random
git repository, random text file, or folder on Dropbox that I have to remember. 

### Things I would like to change

- <del>Permalinks of posts. I'd like them to be simpler.</del>
- On the main page; it lists the date, then post title. It looks sort of ugly.
- Ordering of posts. Reverse chronological doesn't seem like the best decision,
  given I'm updating posts frequently. Although I don't know what would be
  better.
- My about page. I'm trying out the agency theme to make it look modern. On
  second thought, I don't really like it.

## Personal Websites I like

Sites that I like either for their aesthetic design, content, or ways they
organize their content.

- [Philip Greenspun](http://philip.greenspun.com/): A plain site with lots of
  quirky content seems to be a winning combination.
- [Mark Verber](http://www.verber.com/mark/): Another plain website with great
  content.
- [Cosma Shalizi](http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/): Continuing
  the trend. His notebook section is especially interesting, I'd like to make my
  own version of that eventually.
- [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/): An example of a
  PhD's academic website 
- [Edward Yang](http://ezyang.com/): Another PhD student.
- [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is/): His blog. I like the perfectionism in his
  writing.
- [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/): Nice looking blog with posts, with a
  similar style of perfectionism. 
- [Graham Hicks](http://grahamhicks.com/): Cool one page design.  
- [Becoming Minimalist](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/) has a nice taste on the large picture before content theme.
- [Buster Benson's Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) is like something I have, but public.
- [Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror blog](http://blog.codinghorror.com/) posts infrequently, but every post is interesting.
