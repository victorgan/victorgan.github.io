title: Digital Organization
---

I'm obsessed with organizing digital baggage. I haven't found a system that
works.

I want to be able to pick up a new laptop and with five minutes of work, have it
in a state with all my programs and dependencies installed, latest version of
all my projects pulled from the repositories, and all my settings saved. And I
want this to work five years from now, robust to depreciated file formats or
technologies. 

I want there to be a canonical place for each digital thing I use. Calendar.
Email. Notes, both hand-drawn and typed. Code and research projects, both
current and past. Receipts, contacts, finances, copies of personal documents,
passwords, school assignments, papers, book reviews, music, videos, photos,
research paper archive. Each of these things should have one canonical home
where I know I can always find the most up-to-date version. Each should be
editable online and available offline. Each in an archive-suitable file format
and have no ongoing costs for long-term viability, and have some sort of
versioning. Each should be quickly and intuitively accessible on all operating
systems including mobile. Each should be encrypted. Each should be backed up
multiple times. I should be able to seamlessly track cashflows, project
management goals and fitness benchmarks. I want to be able to understand all
files 50 years from now, when standards have changed, which means file format
specifications might have to be stored as well. 

For now, this seems to be out of reach. Many solutions have elegant back-ends,
for example plain text with git, but is lacking a user interface that makes
accessing and changing the data convenient enough to be feasible.

I want a git repository with all my other git repositories as submodules, so
whenever I start a new system I can simply pull from the meta-repository.

I want to have a list of my online representation.
