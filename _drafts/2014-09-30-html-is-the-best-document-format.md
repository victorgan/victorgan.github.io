## What's out there

- physical pen and paper
- plain text / markdown
- html files
- latex files compiled to PDF
- Google docs
- one note files
- word documents

## Pen and paper

- Quickest, by an order of magnitude
- Can lay things out 

## Plain text / Markdown

- Can be compiled to HTML
- easy to create

## Latex

- Messy to read raw
- Best-looking output short of InDesign

## HTML

- can embed videos
- can embed pictures
- can easily be linked
- stored remotely, always up to date
- hyperlinks
- browsers
- it's the best file explorer

- hard to constrain formatting
- broken links, possible
- hard to create (compared to Google docs)

## Google Docs

- WYSIWYG: easy REPL/format editing feedback loop

## What you see is what you get

Are there any benfits of clean syntax? For example, latex is very messy. It's
hard to interpret.

## Features

- collaborative editing
- cleanliness
