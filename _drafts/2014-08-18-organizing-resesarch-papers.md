title: Organizing Research Papers

What's the best way to keep research papers organized?
<!--end excerpt-->

Research papers seem sort of archaic. They're bound by publication limits to be
a couple pages, so they're very information dense and hard to read for the
layperson. They're made to be accepted by an expert panel of reviewers, which
makes the target audience the foremost experts in the field - again, not too
helpful for the layperson. But because the author can't assume the reviewer is
totally acquainted with the field, a 'state-of-the-art' section is often
included. This can be helpful, but in practice this clutters the page if you're
already familiar with it, and the information is repeated multiple times for
each paper.  They also cite references to other papers, which are themselves
hard to get up-to-date with. Also, many of these papers are behind paywalls that
are prohibitively expensive for someone not affiliated to a school or research
lab. 

Compare this to Wikipedia. The entries are ideally as long or as short as
needed. Complexity is encapuslated with hyperlinks: if you're already familiar
with at topic, background information doesn't clutter the page, but if you need
to get up to speed, the background information is a click away. And everything
is accessible by anyone.

Ideally, you'd be able to skim through research papers as fast as skimming
through Wikipedia or TVTropes articles, and follow references until you find
something interesting. If you're an expert in the field, this seems to be the
case already, but not so for the graduate student just starting out, or someone
changing fields. 

## The Requirements

- Platform independent (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- Machine independent (stored on the cloud, somewhere)

## What's Out There

### Bibliography Management: Mendeley et al.
These programs store all of your PDFs and make it easy for bibliography
creation. If you use latex, citations can be solved by finding the paper in
google scholar and copying the .bib citation into your document. To me it seems
a lot simpler, and doesn't bind your PDFs to a specific program.

## What Works for Me

I rename each pdf to a standardized naming scheme. (last name of first author)
(year) (first word of title). This is also used in Latex references. It gives
the same amount of information as (last name et al., year). I then refer to that
paper by this name throughout everything.

Then I take notes on them in OneNote.
