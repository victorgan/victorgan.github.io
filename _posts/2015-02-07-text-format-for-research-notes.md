Markdown:
- made for HTML
- HTML is easily shareable
- [Scholarly Markdown](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/09/07/commonmark-and-the-future-of-scholarly-markdown/)

Latex:
- made for typesetting PDFs
- comprehensive feature set
- handles references nicely
- easy to port to papers when needed

So far, I'll stick with Latex.
