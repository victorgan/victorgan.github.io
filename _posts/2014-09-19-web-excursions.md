The term humbly copied from http://brettterpstra.com/. Things I've found on the
web that interest me.


- [Janteloven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante)
  
  > The ten rules state:
  > You're not to think you are anything special.
  > You're not to think you are as good as we are.
  > You're not to think you are smarter than we are.
  > You're not to convince yourself that you are better than we are.
  > You're not to think you know more than we do.
  > You're not to think you are more important than we are.
  > You're not to think you are good at anything.
  > You're not to laugh at us.
  > You're not to think anyone cares about you.
  > You're not to think you can teach us anything.
  > These ten principles or commandments are often claimed to form the "Jante's Shield" of the Scandinavian people.
  > In the book, the Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes   >   > against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability and uniformity.
