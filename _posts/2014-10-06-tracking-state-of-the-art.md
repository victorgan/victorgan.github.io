title: RPE Tracking State of the Art
---

## Goal: Find State of the Art in Tracking with RGB-D Cameras

### Procedure

1. Google Scholar Search: 'tracking'
2. List benchmarks and datasets
3. List important people and research groups
4. Take saved papers and link them here
5. Write up a brief literature review



### Initial Thoughts

- Struck is one of the best 2D algorithms for 2011

### Benchmarks

##### Princeton Tracking Benchmark: [http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu/](http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu/)

- 100 RGBD videos
- 15 evaluated algorithms
	- 
- mostly traditional generic 'tracking', no 'tracking-by-detection'
