Ideas I may eventually flesh out
<!--end excerpt-->

### Random

- What can I get for X dollars? Similar to http://www.xdollars.org/ but working.
  This will give you an idea of what X dollars are worth, and how you should
  spend your money. Maybe just images. Maybe use machine learning to get most salient objects.
- A review site to end all review sites. Pretty charts that say where items rank
  compared to other items on certain criteria. Dustin Curtis mentions:

> one that 80% of people would consider to be the best toaster in the world.

- Make something/find a solution that makes it really easy to perform and write up small,
  one-day experiments. 
    - For every experiment, allow it to expand, like that list making thing.    
    - export into markdown
    - github/bitbucket/git backup, push
    - map to functions you write.
    
- Make research papers use hyperlinks. Man, it's archaic!

### Research

- Beat the background subtraction state-of-the-art (changedetection.net) using
  statistics. So far, it's very 'hand-crafted'
