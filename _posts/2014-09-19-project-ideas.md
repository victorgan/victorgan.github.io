  spend your money.
- A review site to end all review sites. Pretty charts that say where items rank
  compared to other items on certain criteria. Dustin Curtis mentions:

### Research

- Beat the background subtraction state-of-the-art (changedetection.net) using
  statistics. So far, it's very 'hand-crafted'
