In the main square, there were lots of stalls selling fruit juice. The posted price for a large mixed drink was 20 Morrocan Dihrams. I tried buying it a couple times.

- Once I asked for a better price. I got 15 dihrams and a picture with me in the stall.
- Once I tried to make two juice stalls compete. One says yes to 15 dihrams for two large mixed drinks, the other says that's way too low, but that they were the first to offer 10 dihrams for one. The seller of 15 dihrams for two ended up watering down both drinks.
- I later striaght up asked for 10 dihrams for a large drink; not watered down. They ended up not filling up the cup all the way.

I also tried to buy some 1.5L water bottles.

- I went to a shop out of the main square, I asked the price, a person in front said 10 dihrams, but the person behind gave me it for 6 dihrams; perhaps a miscommunication.
- I went to the same shop again and gave a 10 dihram coin and a one dihram coin without asking the price. I got a 5 dihram coin back.
- I went to another shop, took the bottle out of the fridge, put it on the counter and put a 10 dihram coin down. The clerk said something along the lines of "finale?". I nodded yes. He took it and gave no change. I later realized I put a 5 dihram coin down.
