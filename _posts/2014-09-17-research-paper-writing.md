title: Research Paper Writing
---

[ ] Research Problem:
[ ] 	Can you write the research statement in one sentence?
[ ] 	Is it falsifiable
[ ] 	Is this a real problem? Does this problem actually exist?
[ ] Data
[ ] 	Real-world data?
[ ] 	Is the data set an appropriate size?
[ ] Related work
[ ] 	Context compared to current solution
[ ] 	Explain differences with our solution / why their solutions don't apply
[ ] 	How this solution fits in to current topics
[ ] 	Indicate what needs to be done
[ ] Solving the Problem
[ ] 	Is this is the simplest solution to get results this good?
[ ] 		Have you eliminated all simpler ideas?
[ ] 	Are all complexities justified
[ ] 	Have you looked to other fields for solutions?
[ ] 	Are you sure the results from papers you've cited are correct?
[ ] 	Is the solution brittle?
[ ] 		For every parameter (by logic, reason or experiment):
[ ] 			Is there some way to set a good value for the parameter
[ ] 			The exact value of the parameter makes little difference
[ ] 	Are all choices justified
[ ] 		If choice was arbitrary, explicitly state. "we tried multiple, found no differences, so omitted results for brevity"
[ ] 		Additional criteria in additional tech report
[ ] Figures, tables and pictures whenever possible
[ ] 	Do all figures clearly communicate the idea?
[ ] 	Are all figures as polished as possible?
[ ] 	Labels in figures do not conver data
[ ] 	Is psuedocode too long?
[ ] Have some variance estimate on performance measures (do everything 10 times)
[ ] Avoid "Laundry list" citations
[ ] 	Read every single paper referenced
[ ] 	Broad reference bundles [a, b, c, d] needed?
[ ] 	If paper A says something about paper B, don't just copy paper A's opinion
[ ] 	
[ ] This paper is in scope of the conference, eg. KDD
[ ] 	Did you read/reference KDD papers?
[ ] 	Is it framed as KDD paper
[ ] 	Is it tested on KKD datasets?
[ ] 	Did you use common KDD evaluation metrics?
[ ] 	Write explicit section that says "at first glance, this might seem like problem X, but…"
[ ] The experiments are reproducable
[ ] 	Webpage for data and paper itself
[ ] 	Using just the webpage, can you recreate all experiments in the paper?
[ ] Is it too similar to your last paper?
[ ] 	Did you reference previous work
[ ] 	Did you explicitly spend at least a paragraph explaining how you are extending your work
[ ] 	Redo intro text/figures
[ ] 	Did you include last work in comparisons?
[ ] Did you acknowledge all weaknesses?
[ ] 	Explain why the work is still useful even with weaknesses, and how it might be fixed
[ ] Did you unfairly diminish work by others?
[ ] 	Send a preview to rival authors: "Dear Sue, we are trying to extend your idea and wanted to make sure we represented your work correctly and fairly, would you mind taking a look…"
[ ] Is there an easier way to solve this problem?
[ ] 	Include strawmen ("while we do not expect X to work well because of Y, we include it for completeness…")
[ ] 	Explicitly write explanation as to why other methods won't work (don't just say [1] says it)
[ ] Referenced related work/idea is already known?
[ ] 	Detailed literature search
[ ] 	Write a longer tech report and say in paper: "see our tech report on full literature"
[ ] 	"In our paper we reintroduced an obscure result and show…"
[ ] Interesting and important problem
[ ] 	Test on real data
[ ] 	Domain expert/collaborator help with motivation
[ ] 	Explicitly state why problem is important
[ ] 	Estimate value "$40,000 in annual savings" "crimes solved" lived saved"
[ ] Polished
[ ] 	
[ ] Proofread
[ ] Can I do anything to stop the reviewer from having to think?
[ ] First page: is it clear
[ ] 	What is the problem
[ ] 	Why is it interesting and important
[ ] 	Why is it hard? Why do naïve approaches fail?
[ ] 	Why hasn't it been solved before? What's wrong with previous proposed solutions?
[ ] 	What are the key components of my approach and results? Any limitations?
[ ] 	Summary of contributions: Major points in bulleted form, references to sections
[ ] Is it reproducible
[ ] 	Explicitly: give data, parameter settings
[ ] 	Implicitly: can reproduce in reasonable time, annotated, clear
[ ] 	Is code provided (say in a mock google drive/dropbox account for double-blind studies)
[ ] Check Word meanings:
[ ] 	Optimal
[ ] 	Proved
[ ] 	Significant
[ ] 	Complexity
[ ] 	Correlated
[ ] 	Etc
[ ] 	Mined
[ ] 	Define acronyms before they are used
[ ] Remove unnecessary phrases:
[ ] 	"In this paper" remove
[ ] 	Actual (no meanings in sentence, remove)
[ ] 	Theoretically (no meaning, remove)
[ ] Avoid weak language:
[ ] 	Prefer "it will" vs "might" or "has been shown"
[ ] 	Do not say "attempt", "aiming"
[ ] 	We do not try to do this, we do this
[ ] Avoid overstating
[ ] Directly quote other papers
[ ] Active voice
[ ] Use all the space available (no trailing space in last page)
[ ] Use colour in the text
