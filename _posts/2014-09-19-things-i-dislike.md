title: Things I Dislike
---

Sept 2014:

- Web pages with a gigantic picture at the top, which forces you to scroll down
  for the content. 
- Web pages that scroll the background asynchronously with your own scrolling.
  It was a cool gimmick when it first came out. Now it's annoying.
- When web pages do something when you click a white space or text. I like
  highlighting text as I read. This is really frustrating.
