# Object Proposals

Alternative to sliding windows: proposing 'objectness'

Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation

> Examples for generating region proposals include: objectness [1], selective
> search [39], category-independent object proposals [14], constrained parametric
> min-cuts (CPMC) [5], multi-scale combinatorial grouping [3], and Cires¸an et al.
> [6], who detect mitotic cells by applying a CNN to regularly-spaced square
> crops, which are a special case of region proposals. While R-CNN is agnostic to
> the particular region proposal method, we use selective search to enable a
> controlled comparison with prior detection work (e.g., [39, 41]).


# Mid-Level Features

- [doersch2013mid]({{ site.url }}/assets/papers/doersch2013mid.pdf):

> Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the
level of complexity higher than typical “visual words”, but lower than full-blown
semantic objects.
