title: RPE Problem Definition
---

## Problem Definition

- Idenfity objects and their trajectories in egocentric videos (i.e. videos
  taken from a wheelchair)
- RGB-D Cameras
- Identify when objects are coming at you

## Perfect Solution
- Track all objects, all the time
- Treats moving objects and stationary objects in a unified framework
- Detect -any- object (people, benches, tables, chairs, walls)
- Localization?
- Velocity prediction, or using velocity information from other sensor
- Beats state-of-the-art: computational efficiency, accuracy, simplicity
