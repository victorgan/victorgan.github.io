title: Canonical Folders

## Overview
I have a system for organizing files in a filesystem. The system has a single rule. Additional best practices naturally emerge, but the rule stands alone.

**Every folder name is prefixed by a single digit**.

I call the system **Canonical Folders**. A folder is a canonical folder if:
- Its name is prefixed by a single digit,
- Its digit is unique among sibling folders and directly follows the previous digit, and
- Every folder in it is also a canonical folder. Every single folder.


Here's a truncated example of the canonical folders for my zettelkasten-style knowledge garden:

```

## Details
This system imposes one strict, draconian rule, and restricts nothing else. I love it. The design has four primary features.

- Folders feel curated. It makes a folder feel *intentionally designed* and part of a system, instead of one-off and ad-hocly created. You will care and remember about these intentionally named folders more.
- It constrains you to max 10 folders per level. This enforces you to keep the number of folders per level limited to a human's working memory capacity. Rarely should you reach number 9. If you do, it is time to re-design your folder structure. This constraint both forces you to organize when necessary and frees you from pre-emptive over-organization. This limit makes each folder ooze importance because of the imposed scarcity.
- It lets you control ordering. This avoids ad-hoc alphabetical ordering and makes you *intentionally choose* an appropriate ordering.
- It's self-evident. It orders ten or less things. You don't need an explicit explanation of the system. It's more affordant than two digits or high unicode characters that need additional explaining. It's simple, not intimidating, and aesthetically pretty, which will make you care about adhering to it.

Because the system will invite you to curate a series of human-designed folders, I call them canonical folders. You'll craft these folders for yourself in a high-touch way so you'll know where everything is the same way you know where your cutlery is in your kitchen.

## How to Start using Canonical Folders
Begin by lazily making canonical folders for the content you are storing. Do this only as needed. 

Begin with 0. Once you reach 2 or higher, consider renumbering them to form a logical ordering. A great default order is the time that you created the folder.

Once you reach 7 or higher, consider creating a general, encompassing folder and put several of the existing folders in there, resetting the numbering to start from 0.

You will realize things in canonical folders will become more like things in the physical world. "Where did I put that note on the finance book I read? Oh, it's probably 4 Media -> 0 Books. Oh wait, it's in 6 Interests -> 2 Finance." "Let me peruse my digital bookshelf at 4 Media -> 0 Books". Canonical folders will help you develop a  mental layout of where all your digital files are. This encourages serendipitous discovery compared to simply using search; similar to how it's more rewarding to navigate to a oft-visited place via known landmarks vs. using a GPS. You will feel more in control. Everything will have its canonical place.

## Conclusion
Canonical folders is  a system to help you tidy up your computer files. You use it by putting a digit in front of every folder name. It's theraputic, speeds up retrieval time, but most importantly, the act of making them helps you categorize and synthesize what information you are storing which helps you generate new ideas. Like finally getting a room organized with proper storage, it'll be hard to go back because the maintenance effort is far outweighed by the cognitive peace achieved.

It's hard to communicate the benefits of this practice until you earnestly give it a shot. If this caught your interest, quickly try it out now on some files you need to organize. Especially if you don't have the time!
