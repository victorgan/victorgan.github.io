Some notes on how this site was built. Feel free to get your own copy of the
[source](https://github.com/victorgan/victorgan.github.io) (click 'Download ZIP'
on the right hand side) to play around with.

## Host: GitHub Pages
Pros: Free and lets you push static files
Cons: Static pages only.

## Site Generator / Content Management System: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
Mostly because it's already integrated with GitHub pages. You write files in
plain text/markdown and it converts it to static HTML pages with a template
applied.  What GitHub does is if you upload the plain text files in a
repository, it will convert them to HTML pages on their servers.

I've used Hakyll in the past, but I realized I'm not too interested in the
actual details of converting text files into HTML files.

## Registrar: Namecheap
I've been using them for a while without complaints.

[Here](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/)
are some pictures to help you get set up. Step 1 is creating a file with your
URL, and step 2 is pointing the forwarding address to GitHub's servers.

## Website Template: Poole
For now. [Here](http://getpoole.com/).

## Website Additions: Disqus Comments, Navigation Links, Google Analytics
Pretty much everything in
[this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) guide.

## Website Additions: MathJax
This allows math equations to look pretty like \\( 1/x^{2} \\), 
or in block, \\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\] 

See [this](http://christopherpoole.github.io/using-mathjax-on-github-pages/).
