<!--TODO: history of past sites -->

How this site was built and designs I like.
<!--end excerpt-->

## The Current Site

Feel free to get your own copy of this site
([github](https://github.com/victorgan/victorgan.github.io))
([zip](https://github.com/victorgan/victorgan.github.io/archive/master.zip)) to
play around with.

### Host: GitHub Pages
Pros: Free and lets you push static files
Cons: Static pages only.

### Site Generator / Content Management System: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
Mostly because it's already integrated with GitHub pages. You write files in
plain text/markdown and Jekyll converts the files to static HTML pages with a
template applied.  

### Registrar: Namecheap
I've been using them for a while without complaints.

[Here](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/)
are some pictures to help you get set up. Step 1 is creating a file with your
URL, and step 2 is pointing the forwarding address to GitHub's servers.

### Website Template: Poole and Agency
For now. [Here](http://getpoole.com/)
and [here](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/).

### Website Additions: Disqus Comments, Navigation Links, Google Analytics
Pretty much everything in
[this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) guide.

### Website Additions: MathJax
This allows math equations to look pretty like \\( 1/x^{2} \\), 
or in block, \\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\] 

### Tools to Write Stuff
