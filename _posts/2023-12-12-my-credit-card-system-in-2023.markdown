title: My Credit Card System in 2023
---

When I first moved to the US, I got a credit card at my employer’s orientation day, the only one I could get with no credit history. I used it for quite a few years. Lately though, I started getting into the credit card points game. I find it hard to explain to people why this game is so fun because there’s a lot of danger with credit, there’s some perverse pyramid-scheme elements with affiliate links, and not everyone has the ability to play it. The time spent researching also likely won’t be worth the money you get out of this hobby. But if you like the thrill of a good deal and refining the way you think about money, it can be a really fun waste of time. Here’s my current setup.

## Credit Cards of 2021
I got the **Citi Double Cash** shortly after my first credit card for the 2% back, with no sign-up bonus (SUB). Then I got the **Citi Costco** card (SUB of a water bottle or something) that I only use for Costco Gas now.

In 2021 I got the **Citi Premier** (80K SUB) because it had a good SUB at the time, is known to be harder to get later on, let me access Citi transfer partners, and has great multipliers. I thought I’d just keep this and the Double Cash as a simple two card setup for the rest of my life if I stopped churning (spoiler: I didn’t).

Around the same time, I got the **Chase Sapphire Preferred** (100k SUB), aka CSP. I knew this overlapped the Citi Premier in spending categories (who cares, good SUB), but I got it for the SUB and primary auto rental insurance. 

The last card I got in 2021 was the **Amex Platinum** (150K SUB), for the SUB and to flex on others at lounges. 

I got these cards mostly for their all-time high SUBs. I basically used the Citi Premier and Double Cash for most everyday purchases, Amex Platinum for air travel and lounge access, and CSP for car rentals. I also had access to transfer partners from all 3 banks, but I never actually spent any points cause of decision fatigue.

My spend is relatively low so the actual multipliers don’t matter too much compared to the SUBs, though it is a bit satisfying to match the spending to the right card.

## Credit Cards of 2022
In January 2022 I got the **Chase Aeroplan** (2x50K Cert SUB), purely for the SUB. Later I would realize this card’s hidden power (10% Aeroplan transfer bonus + 1.25% pay yourself back on any travel).

At this time I was 4/24 (Citi Premier, CSP, Amex Platinum, Chase Aeroplan), which matters for Chase applications, so I stopped applying to others. I didn’t realize I could’ve applied for business cards, which I should’ve done throughout 2022.

## Credit Cards of 2023
I got an **Chase Ink Business Cash** (90K SUB), my first business card, to stay under 5/24.

I got the **Chase Ink Business Preferred** (100K SUB) business card and downgraded the CSP to the no-fee **Chase Freedom Unlimited**. This let me keep access to Chase’s transfer partners without adding to my 5/24, and downgrading instead of cancelling means my credit score doesn’t tank.

Here’s when I really started getting into the game. My rate of getting cards was limited by two factors: my natural spend ($2.5k a month on rent) and the rule of thumb to only apply for a Chase business card every 3 months (known as riding the Ink Train). I want to stay under 5/24 to keep riding the Ink Train (90k SUB’s with no annual fee choo choo). Luckily, in the summer I got back to 1/24, so I applied for 2 more personal cards this year.

I got the **Amex Gold** (90k SUB). I cancelled the Amex Platinum in 2023 because I wasn’t using enough credits naturally, which were quite a pain to keep track of. I didn’t downgrade the Plat to the Gold because then I wouldn’t have been able to get the Gold SUB, so my credit score took a small hit. I got the Gold mainly for the close to all-time high SUB, to maintain Amex points, and for the marginal 1x increase in restaurant/grocery multiplier over the Citi Premier.

At this time, I took a trip and paid $200/night in cash for some rip-off Hilton hotel, and all I got was free breakfast from my Amex Plat. This made me reconsider my hotel strategy, and so I got the **Chase IHG One Premier** (140k SUB) and **Chase IHG One Premier Business** (140k SUB). I missed the higher 175k SUB on these, but I got these for the still high SUB and when you redeem points at IHG hotels you get the 4th night free. They also come with 40k free night certificates after the first year, so I wanted to get both close together so I can spend both of them in one trip in ongoing years.

I then got the **Amex Business Gold** (150K + 15K*2 SUB) since it didn’t add to 5/24 nor Chase’s business card timers and came with Walmart+ (I’m too cheap for Amazon Prime). I missed the timing for 20k points per 4k spend on employee cards, but got the 15k one, which makes this card’s SUB my most lucrative yet.

That’s all my credit cards so far. Next up is more Ink-Training with more Chase Ink Business Cash and Chase Ink Business Unlimited SUBs. I’ll also likely cancel the Amex Business Gold and maybe the Chase Aeroplan to avoid the fees.

## Hotel Strategy
I used to use Hotwire to try and find the cheapest hotel or find the cheapest AirBNB, but now I’m at a point where I’ll pay ~30% more for a clean hotel in a central location. I don’t care about ultra-luxury properties for now.

**IHG** has periodic point sales where you can buy points at 50 cents each. I bought 500k points for $2500 in 2023 and have 280k from the two card SUBs. I find with the 4th night free benefit, this is often the cheapest option on the US West Coast. A side benefit is because I can always buy IHG points, I don’t worry about the opportunity cost of using the points like I do with Chase or Citi points.

**Hyatt** properties also have good value when redeeming points, mostly on the US East Coast. I get these by converting Chase points to Hyatt points, and will do it if I can get >1.8 cents per point (cpp) value. There’s not many properties, so it’s hard to solely rely on this.

**Choice Privileges** has low end hotels in national parks, which are great for road trips. I haven’t used points for this, but I’ve heard there’s good value in transferring Citi points at a 1:2 ratio from Citi:Choice.

Hilton points are bad until the super high end, and status is only worth it for luxury, so I don’t mess with either. I haven’t looked too much into Marriott or other hotel chains.

In practice, if I’m thinking of a trip, I’ll first book an IHG hotel with points right away. Because of my point stash, before I even commit to a trip I can lock in a good deal, and they’re fully refundable if I find something better or bail on the trip. Then if I have more time I find Hyatt and Choice Privileges options on points, as well as any cash options (from these chains and others), and put them all in a janky spreadsheet to see which has the lowest effective price taking into account point values, current cash promos, Rakuten cash back, etc.

## Airfare Strategy
I prefer direct economy flights. I don’t care too much about business or first class unless it’s relatively affordable even with points. I’ll pay hundreds of dollars more for a direct flight instead of a connecting one to save time. I like lounges mostly for the free food, but don’t need them.

I listed out all the **direct flights from Seattle** and found the top ones I’d like to take in the next couple years: domestic US flights, Toronto, Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul, Shanghai and Mexico City. I went to Europe my past two trips, so that’s on the back burner. There’s also destinations I’d like to take that have indirect flights, but I haven’t looked into them that much yet.

One sweet spot is Turkish Airlines points (transferred from Citi points), which transfers to Star Alliance partners United or Air Canada. I go back to **Toronto** quite often, which takes 20k points for a direct flight. These tickets go for $400-$700 USD, so it’s an easy >2 cpp. I had to call in to book this last time, which was a little cumbersome. 

It’s relatively hard to find good point deals on **domestic US flights**. I’ll use Turkish points on United metal if >2cpp. I’ve heard using Virgin points on Delta metal, and British Airways points on American Airlines or Alaska metal are also good. Southwest cash fare as well (this doesn’t appear in Google flights, use the site directly).

The only direct flight to **Mexico City** is through AeroMexico, a SkyTeam Alliance member. Using Virgin points (also a SkyTeam Alliance member) instead of paying by cash can yield >2 cpp.

ANA, a Star Alliance member, has direct flight to **Tokyo**, bookable with any Star Alliance member including Air Canada and surprisingly with Virgin points.

Eva Air (Star Alliance) has a direct flight to **Taipei**. Korean Air and Delta (SkyTeam) and Asiana (Star Alliance) has direct flights to **Seoul**.

I haven’t looked into Shanghai yet.

When booking a flight, I’ll look at the cheapest cash price, cash price for a direct flight, and point price, and choose whichever one makes sense.


## Point Strategy
Right now I have four sources of points: Citi points from spending, Chase points from Ink Trains, Amex points from SUBs and spending, and IHG points from direct purchases.

I’m saving my Citi points for Seattle to Toronto flights, since I know I’ll use them for this flight and the value is great. Since I don’t have a way to SUB farm these points, I’d only use them for other Turkish flights or Choice Privileges hotel stays that are >2cpp.

Chase points are extremely plentiful since I’m under 4/24 and riding the Ink Train. Hyatt redemptions are good when available, but only when the marginal savings over other point or cash hotel options is notable. Otherwise, converting Chase points into Aeroplan points during at least a 20% transfer bonus and using the Aeroplan card to pay for travel expenses gives 1.625 cpp (20% + 10% bonus, and then 1.25 cents per point), which can be used to pay for things that points don’t cover or when paying with cash is the better option. I’ll likely only use these two options.

Amex has multiple Skyteam and Star Alliance transfer partners. Virgin seems to be the top tier Skyteam partner (followed by Flying Blue), so it’s worth transferring points to them when there’s a 30% transfer bonus. Aeroplan, ANA, Avianca and Singapore Airlines are Star Alliance transfer partners, with IMO Aeroplan being the top tier. I’ll wait for a 30% transfer bonus for Aeroplan, but if another Star Alliance member has a transfer bonus when I’m booking a Star Alliance flight, I might as well use that one.

IHG points are only used at IHG. I prefer to use them over Hyatt because even if Hyatt can get better cents per point, Chase points have the opportunity cost to cover non-hotel travel expenses, which might save more in total.
