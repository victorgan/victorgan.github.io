Assertion: HTML is the best document format, even for school assignments.

Frame it 

## What's out there

Generally, there are

- plain text
- latex files compiled to PDF
- word documents
- one note files
- physical pen and paper
- html files
- Google docs

## Why it's better

HTML advantages:

- can embed videos
- can embed pictures
- can easily be linked
- stored remotely, always up to date
- hyperlinks
- browsers

HTML disadvantages:

- hard to constrain formatting
- broken links, 
- hard to create (compared to Google docs)

## What you see is what you get

Are there any benfits of clean syntax? For example, latex is very messy. It's
hard to interpret.

- collaborative editing
- cleanliness
