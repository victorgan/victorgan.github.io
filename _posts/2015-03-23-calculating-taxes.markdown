Note that there's no currency conversion going on; California and Washington use
US dollars. Interestingly, California, Ontario and British Columbia all have
pretty similar tax rates (ignoring currency differences), which converges to
Alberta's. Washington, because it has no state income tax, means you'll likely
save around 4-10 grand from the tax person.

on how far your dollar goes does something similar and also includes the cost of
living.

For completeness, here's a plot of the effective tax rates for all the Canadian
provinces.
