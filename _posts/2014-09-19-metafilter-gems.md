### [Negotiating with Partners](http://ask.metafilter.com/137148/What-clever-relationship-hacks-have-you-come-up-with#1960336):

> Almost 20 years ago, my then-partner and I read a little pamphlet about
> relationships. I don't remember its name or who wrote it. But it said that
> people often start negotiating from what they think they can get, not what
> they really want--so even if the other person says yes, they are still
> disappointed.  It said that people should start by being honest about 100% of
> what they want.
> 
> My partner and I use this all the time, for things big and small. "My 100%
> would be for today to include a couple of hours to myself." "My 100% would be
> having dinner before we see the movie." "My 100% would be to move to a bigger
> house in two years."
> 
> It's great because one thing that is surprising is how often you can have your
> 100%--and then you feel really lucky and happy and loved. And you also have
> the satisfaction of knowing that you gave your partner what they _really_
> wanted. On the other hand, if the 100% isn't possible and you have to
> negotiate down from there ("I have a lot of chores to do so I don't think I
> could leave the house for two hours...but what if I take the kids with me to
> Home Depot to get the stuff we need to fix the door? Then you'd have about an
> hour to yourself.") you at least know that what you wanted was heard.

> Everyone we've told this to begins using it and then raves about how great it
> is. Now we use it all the time with friends as well as with each other.

### [How to Choose Where To Eat](http://ask.metafilter.com/126816/What-conversations-are-a-MUST-before-two-people-get-married#1812279):

> Learn how to play 5-3-1. It's a trick to settle the "where do you want to
> eat?" "I don't care, where do you want to eat?" game. One partner names 5
> places, the other eliminates two of those choices, and the first one
> eliminates the remaining two. It's decision making in turns, and it works just
> as well as anything else. 
> 
> Maybe someday, someone will solve the dilemma of why two educated self-aware
> people can make major life decisions but are wholly unable to commit between
> Chinese and burgers.
