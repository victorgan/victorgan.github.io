Metafilter is an internet community. Here's a collection of posts on metafilter I've liked, at some point. Lots of them are some of the [top favourited](http://infodumpster.org/) on the site, and I've favourited them on my account, but I decided to post them here so I can look back at them at a glance.

### [Say this not that](http://ask.metafilter.com/254331/Say-this-not-that)

> Insert all instances of "but" with "yes, and"
> 
> But makes people instantly defensive. They told you a thought, but says "your thought was wrong here's my thought". Yes, and says "I received your thought and would like to add to it"

> One thing that I learned that is brilliant is that you should phrase things as a positive, not a negative. For example:
> 
> "Remember to clean the cat box." Remember is a positive word, also as the words ring in the ears it's "remember, remember, remember." 
> 
> "Don't Forget to clean the cat box," has two negative words, Don't and Forget. If either one is ringing in the recipient's ears, trust and believe the cats will be tip-toeing on Mt. Poopmore. 
> 
> Replace "don't do X" with "Do Y." 

> When thanking servicepeople, I try to specifically thank them for what they have actually done. A quick, robotic "Thank you" can be a knee-jerk reaction and it doesn't hold much weight. "Thank you for helping me find the saurkraut" or "Thank you for hooking up my cable, now I can watch the Olympics" helps to bring home what the person did. As a person who often works the front desk, I like to hear why I'm being thanked. It's much more meaningful than just a social reflex "thankyou" as the person is walking away.

A list of life hacks.

### [The Old Man and the C Drive](http://ask.metafilter.com/164388/The-Old-Man-and-the-C-Drive)

> What are some comprehensive one-topic websites maintained by cranky old guys

### [Negotiating with Partners](http://ask.metafilter.com/137148/What-clever-relationship-hacks-have-you-come-up-with#1960336):

> Almost 20 years ago, my then-partner and I read a little pamphlet about
> relationships. I don't remember its name or who wrote it. But it said that
> people often start negotiating from what they think they can get, not what
> they really want--so even if the other person says yes, they are still
> disappointed.  It said that people should start by being honest about 100% of
> what they want.
> 
> My partner and I use this all the time, for things big and small. "My 100%
> would be for today to include a couple of hours to myself." "My 100% would be
> having dinner before we see the movie." "My 100% would be to move to a bigger
> house in two years."
> 
> It's great because one thing that is surprising is how often you can have your
> 100%--and then you feel really lucky and happy and loved. And you also have
> the satisfaction of knowing that you gave your partner what they _really_
> wanted. On the other hand, if the 100% isn't possible and you have to
> negotiate down from there ("I have a lot of chores to do so I don't think I
> could leave the house for two hours...but what if I take the kids with me to
> Home Depot to get the stuff we need to fix the door? Then you'd have about an
> hour to yourself.") you at least know that what you wanted was heard.

### [How to Choose Where To Eat](http://ask.metafilter.com/126816/What-conversations-are-a-MUST-before-two-people-get-married#1812279):

> Learn how to play 5-3-1. It's a trick to settle the "where do you want to
> eat?" "I don't care, where do you want to eat?" game. One partner names 5
> places, the other eliminates two of those choices, and the first one
> eliminates the remaining two. It's decision making in turns, and it works just
> as well as anything else.
