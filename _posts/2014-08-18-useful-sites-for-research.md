title: Useful Sites for Research

<!--TODO: history of past sites -->

A list of various sites for research, catered towards computer science. A lot of
them I haven't read yet; it's mostly for my sake.

### Initially Useful
- [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/): Has RSS feeds and notifications of
  call for papers.
- [Metacademy](http://www.metacademy.org/): Goes through various machine
  learning concepts
- [The PhD Grind](http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm): A memoir from a Stanford
  computer science PhD 

### Persistently Useful
- [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/): Google for research papers. You
  also easily get bibtex citations from it. When researching a field, find a
  paper and look at both its citations and papers who cite it to give you an
  idea of the context behind it.
    - 'Bookmark' papers and tag them
- [Google Scholar
  Rankings](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en): Ranks
  tiers of conferences
- [Conference Ranks](http://www.conferenceranks.com): Ranks tiers of
  conferences.

### General 'Advice' Pages
- [How to learn on your own](http://www.metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/learn_on_your_own)
- http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/advice.html
- http://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Research/Advice/network.html

### Topical Links
- [Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Machine
  Learning](http://www.nowpublishers.com/journals/MAL/5): "These are sort of
  intermediate between textbooks and research papers, and are a good way to get
  up to speed on important results of the past decade or so which haven't yet
  found their way into textbooks"
- [Recommended Courses for MIRI Math
  Researchers](http://intelligence.org/courses/): A list of free online courses
  for specific background topics.
- [List of machine learning textbooks on
  Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jeawf/machine_learning_books/)
