<!--TODO: history of past sites -->

I need to get organized.

<!--end excerpt-->
Last updated Sept 15, 2014.

This is pretty much just for my sake to remember where I store things.

### Daily organization

Google Calendar for appointments. Places to Be.
Goole Keep for To do list. Tasks to perform.
Gmail with delayed sending. When Communicating with others.

- To check everyday: Calendar, To do list, Email. Nothing else.
- Problem: Sometimes I put tasks in Calendar, future emails to myself, or
  Google Keep. I need to consolidate. Perhaps just use Google Keep?

### Requirements

- Accessible on the web

### Website

Dropbox -> Website

### PDFs of research papers
Dropbox -> IFTTT
Then edit them in Drawboard PDF and take notes in OneNote

- (+): Papers are kept in an archival file format
- (-): Papers aren't organized.
- (-): No online search (use Google docs?)

### Documents
Currently using: 

- Prototype in OneNote, print out and edit
- Make Latex Documents, edit with vim and/or sharelatex and synced
with dropbox with a git repository
- (+): text files
- (-): no canonical storage area

Other options:

- Google Docs: Better web edits, files centrally stored, easy collaboration, bad
  file type

### OneNote 

Concepts Notebook: Basically a personal Wikipedia for common topics.

- (+): Very easy to write quick and dirty ideas
- (+): Ideas stores in a central location
- (-): Proprietary file format. It can export to pdf, though terribly.

### Books to Read
Goodreads.com

### Other Files to Organize

- Passwords
- Sensitive Documents (banking, bills)
- School
- Contacts
- Photos
- Videos Music
