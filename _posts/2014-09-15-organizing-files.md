I need to get organized.
This is pretty much just for my sake to remember where I store things.

### Daily organization

- Google Calendar for appointments. Places to Be.
- Goole Keep for To do list. Tasks to perform.
- Gmail with delayed sending. When Communicating with others.
- To check everyday: Calendar, To do list, Email. Nothing else.
- Problem: Sometimes I put tasks in Calendar, future emails to myself, or
  Google Keep. I need to consolidate. Perhaps just use Google Keep?

### Website

- The most up-to-date version is on github
- I have an offline version in Dropbox/Website

### PDFs of research papers
Dropbox -> IFTTT
Then edit them in Drawboard PDF and take notes in OneNote

- (+): Papers are kept in an archival file format
- (-): Papers aren't organized.
- (-): No online search (use Google docs?)
- (-): Random dropbox folder.
- Idea: Write a brief literature review summarizing groups of papers, and list
  them here. Store the pdfs in a document here. Con: it'll slow down surveying.
  Pro: I'll actually doucment what I read, instead of relying on memory. Cons:
  copyright issues. Perhaps take this site offline? Boo.

### Documents
Currently using: 

- Prototype in OneNote, print out and edit
- Make Latex Documents, edit with vim and/or sharelatex and synced
with dropbox with a git repository
- (+): text files
- (-): no canonical storage area

Other options:

- Google Docs: Better web edits, files centrally stored, easy collaboration, bad
  file type
- Sparkleshare for automatic committing

### Notes

#### OneNote: Quick and dirty thought dump

Concepts Notebook: Basically a personal Wikipedia for common topics.

- (+): Very easy to write quick and dirty ideas
- (+): Ideas stores in a central location
- (-): Proprietary file format. It can export to pdf, though terribly.

#### Website: Thoughts conceptualized into coherent ideas

- (+): Easily accessible by others and myself
- (+): Easily editable. OneNote notes lends itself to writing down quick notes. I don't like editing them, though, perhaps because there's too many degrees of freedom to get it 'just right': for example, you can move the image arbitrarily. HTML is rendered a specific way, and this constraint makes it easier to make iterative edits to 'perfect' a post.
- (+): A good file format
- (+): As we know, you don't understand something unless you teach it, or write it down. Writing down long, constructed posts lets met articulate and organize my ideas clearly both on the page and in my head.
